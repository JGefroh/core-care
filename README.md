# Care


Care is a cancelled 2D top-down farming game that was originally intended to serve as a tech demo for my  [core-js](https://github.com/jgefroh/core-js) framework.

It is written in pure Javascript w/ Canvas and WebGL2 rendering and no other frameworks.

It's playable at http://care.jgefroh.com - it is very early draft.

This is not intended to be used in a commercial or production environment - it was just a fun hobby project I wrote.
